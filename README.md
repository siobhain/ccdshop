## About 

Memory Lane Jewellery is a fictional online jewellery store selling handmade jewellery.  All pieces are designed and carefully crafted by master goldsmith Julia Diamond. She has created a range of jewellery that can be of sentimental & nostalgic value to whomever wears it.  Each is designed to help create precious memories,  mark milestones & is made from highest quality precious metals to be enjoyed over a lifetime & cherish into the future.  When appropriate, there is option to personalise items by requesting an engraving of your own message to the jewellery item.

## Owners Stipulations 

### Product Pricing & Quantity limits.
The owner Julia has specified that it is a strategic business decision to opt for whole number pricing in order to maintain the feeling of exclusivity and quality in the goods.  It is thought the discerening customer would not fall for the charm pricing of say â‚¬49.99.as a family heirloom. Therefore there are to be no decimal points rendered on the website.

In addition Julia the owner has requested that the quantity ordered be limited to a maximium of 5 as these pieces are all handmade and not mass produced.  At times it may be necessary for her to make to order which may result in delays, in those cases she will contact the customer directly herself.

### Newsletter
Owner does not envisage regular newsletters but perhpas quarterly end of line/offers made exclusively to cusomters - as stock is limited - that have registered for account. Therefore owner will not need mailchimp, A simple `subscribe_newsletter` boolean field in the UserProfile model will suffice, When true user will get newsletter otherwise not & Users are presented with choice during checkout process if they would like to signup for newsletter or not.

### Wedding Rings
Owner just getting into making wedding bands & so just testing the waters with 2 products but this new category is not in the main menus as of yet.

## B2C

This is a business to customer application.  There are several products and a single payment per order. Customers can purchase anonymously or can register for an account in which case they can safe their delivery information &/or subscribe to a quarterly newsletter.  Payment is via Stripe & banking details are not held or saved.

## Agile

Link to [AGILE.md](AGILE.md) file.

## UX

The UX of Boutique is followed almost exactly, I was hoping to put more of my own stamp on it after getting MVP working etc but time not on my side.

![](docs/palette.JPG)

Link to [WIREFRAMES.md](docs/WF.md) file.

## Features

### Common Header & Footer

Header ![](docs/f-commonheader.JPG)
Hover on `SPECIALS` above

Footer ![](docs/f-commonfooter.JPG)

#### Header Navigation Menu & Icons on Large screens

##### Memory Lane Jewellery 
If any part of Memory Lane Jewellery or the favicon in the header is clicked it will return user to the home page.  It is a long title and so gets 7 of the 12 column grid on the header row - so no wrapping before hamburger menu for smaller screens.

##### Search
Search is implemeted same as Boutique Ado, It gets 2 columns of the grid leaving 3 cols for the next section holding `My Account & the basket.  This redispersal of columns in the header row is made late in the day so some screen shots that include the header row may be from when all 3 sections had 4 columns each.

##### My Account
---
|No User logged in|Admin logged in|User logged in|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|![](docs/d-myaccount.JPG)|![](docs/d-admin.JPG)|![](docs/d-mols.JPG)|
|Option to `Register` as new user or `Login`|Extra Options to `Add product` & `View Subscribe list`|Option to view Profile incl order history|

##### Basket 
The Basket icon when clicked goes to Shopping Bag page

##### Dropdown Menus
| Browse :`By Price` selected | For Her : `Bracelets` selected|Design  : `Mix` selected|Specials : `Latest Designs` selected|
| :---: |:---:|:---:|:---:|
|![](docs/d-browse.JPG)|![](docs/d-forher.JPG)|![](docs/d-design.JPG)|![](docs/d-specials.JPG)|

Update : 
A `Contact Us` app` was subsequently added so apologies if some screenshots are out of sync & missing this menu item & indeed the 'Search' in this screenshot is centerstage whereas it was since moced more to the right so title would not wrap.

![](docs/d-contactus.JPG)

###### FOR HER (On large screens only)
The dropdown menus are fairly self explanatory, The 1st `Browse` menu item is a sorting for all products, The following is what is rendered on the `FOR HER` menu

|Earrings|Pendants|
|:---: |:---:|
|![](docs/fh-earrings.JPG)|![](docs/fh-pendant.JPG)|

|Bracelets|Rings|
|:---: |:---:|
|![](docs/fh-brac.JPG)|![](docs/fh-ring.JPG)|

###### DESIGN (on large screens only)
This is listing product by Platinium,  Gold, Silver or a mix of both Gold & Silver, implemented with the `Collection` model.

###### SPECIALS
![](docs/d-specials.JPG)

`Latest Designs` are items that have been recently added to the database & are identified by the keyword "NEW" (case insensitive) in the product description, When the admin user is adding the next set of designs hte keyword NEW will need to be removed from the current Latest designs.

`Offers` are items that have been discounted from a previous RRP, usually they are end of line items that are not selling well, They are identified by the keyword "DISCOUNT" (case insensitive) in the product description, Again it is up the the admin user to add this detail to the description when adjusting price.


##### Banner
Currently the banner has a free delivery message, this may change depending on time of year. For Christmas this year there will be free engraving service & this promotion needs to go on the banner.


#####  The Footer
Footer has link to a privacy policy & a mockup facebook business page.

![](docs/f-commonfooter.JPG)

At width of 611 pixels the title is truncated to initals & this is the resulting footer 

![](docs/r-footer.JPG)


### Home Page 

All pages include common header & footer described above, This is a visual of the home page without common header/footer.

![](docs/h-page.JPG)

The home page has a large `SHOP NOW` button to intice the user to shop, There is hint of the next collection which is called Love-in-Star & a pic of the pendant from this collection.

### SHOP NOW (Products App)

![](docs/p-all.JPG)

The `SHOP NOW` button leads the the all products page, currently 12/13 in the database.  There is a count on top LHS & a Sort dropdown on RHS, The sort can be by Price, Rating, Name or Category & in either direction.  On large screen porducts are displayed 4 across reducing to 3 on tablet sized screen and eventually stacked on top of each other on small mobile screens.

| Laptop | Tablet | Mobile |
| :---: |:---:|:---:|
|![](docs/p-laptop.JPG)|![](docs/p-tablet.JPG)|![](docs/p-mobile.JPG)|

Each product has an image, a name and the following details : Category, Price, Rating (see below) & optional attrributes are Size & Engrave.  Once the user clicks on an image the product detail page will be loaded.

![](docs/p-ballearrings.JPG)

### Product Detail page

|Product sizeable False|Product sizeable True, engrave False| Product sizeable True, engrave True|
|:---: |:---:|:---:|
|![](docs/pd-geo.JPG)|![](docs/pd-mountain.JPG)|![](docs/pd-band.JPG)|

Once in the product detail page it is possible to add the product to the shopping bag with `Add to Bag` button.  
Once item is added to the bag the user will get a toast message as follows

|Product sizeable False|Product sizeable True, engrave False| Product sizeable True, Engrave True|
|:---: |:---:|:---:|
|![](docs/atb-1.JPG)|![](docs/atb-2.JPG)|![](docs/atb-3.JPG)|


### Bag app
This page gives the details of items currently in the bag.

![](docs/b-bag.JPG)

 There are `update` and `remove` links under the Quantity selector for each line item in the bag, this allows user to adjust the quantity (via `update`) or remove the item altogether, Doing either will result in the bag being updated and toast message to the user, In these screenshots I show the `update` 

|Adjust Product sizeable False|Adjust Product sizeable True, engrave False| Adjust Product sizeable True, Engrave True|
|:---: |:---:|:---:|
|![](docs/b-geo.JPG)|![](docs/b-mount.JPG)|![](docs/b-ring.JPG)|

So Removing the Pendant from the shopping bag and adjusting quantities this is contents of shopping bag we will checkout with by clicking on `SECURE CHECKOUT` button on right hand side at end of the page.

![](docs/b-adjusted.JPG)

### Checkout app

User is presented with form to complete delivery details & a summary of the order, If user is logged in and has already chosen to save their delivery details the form will be prefilled.

#### Registered Users : 

Back to our guest order we can see that the order summary contains a count, and line item details including quantity, price & if relevant size and engraving text, subtotal and total.

![](docs/co-ordersummary.JPG)

Fill out the delivery details to complete the order

![](docs/co-delivery.JPG)

User will see  this overlay while stripe does its work

![](docs/co-overlay.JPG)

& then be presented with toast message & confirmation of order.

![](docs/co-toast.JPG)
![](docs/co-confirm.JPG)

User also receives an email unfortunatley don't have screenshot for this particular order but here is one from an order earlier this month

![](docs/email.JPG)

The order has been added to the database (as seen by the admin user) & as CreatedByWebhook in Order is false I know that the order was created by `checkout.views.checkout` & not checkout.webhook_handler`.  This is all immaterial to the user but may be of benefit to the owner/administrator. Majority of orders should be created by checkout and not by webhook handler, If there is an increase in webhook order than it warrents investigation.

![](docs/db-order.JPG)

Engrave Text is saved in the OrderLineItem.

![](docs/db-order-details.JPG)

#### Stripe

The currency is set to Euro in settings.py as all goods are for sale from Ireland.  Stripe requires all Euro amounts to be provided in cents, cents being the smallest Euro unit.  In keeping with the business strategy of whole number pricing,  it was necessary to round up `grand_total` & `stripe_total` using `math.ceil()` when including delivery costs.

##### Stripe Secrets

Use `<input type="hidden"..>` to pass the `client_secret` to stripe server, With the hidden attribute set the user cannot view or interact with the value being passed

##### Strips Credit cards for development
To sucessful payment the `42424242424...` was used and Strip make other card numbers availabe for testing payment declines

|Declined|NoFunds|
|:--- |:---:|
|![](docs/stripe-declined.JPG)|![](docs/stripe-nofunds.JPG)|

##### CreatedByWebhook : Redundancy for payment system on checkout app

There is redundancy build into the Checkout app during Stripe payment processing in cases where the user might close the browser or lose power/connectivity or do something on the client/frontend side that breaks connection with the server during payment processing (the js .done .then on 'stripe.confirmCardPayment') causing the order not to be submitted to the database even though the payment has been made. This is for edge cases only and is achieved by listening for particular stripe webhooks (wh's) which operate like signals in the background and are unaffected by whats going on front end. It is the same implementation as **BoutiqueAdo**. The Stripe account is configured to send wh's to an endpoint such as `https://memorylane-jewellery-63c74e421293.herokuapp.com/checkout/wh/`. A `payment_intent.succeeded` webhook is send by Stripe to signify that the payment has been completed.  Therefore if/when that particular wh is received we know for definite that payment has been made & in normal cases the order will already have been created by `views.checkout` (abeit a slight delay in writing to db using false commit on the save `order_form.save(commit=False)`).  However in an edge case where something happens frontend so that order never gets created in the db, the `payment_intent.succeeded` wh handler will create the order if it finds that it does not exist in the db.  There is a boolean field on the Order model called `CreatedByWebhook` to track such cases.  The site administrator can check for this phenomena using filter on the django admin interface.

#### Step by Step Demonstration 

This is a demo of ordering same product with different engraving/sizes & I will show from Product Details page via Shopping Bag to Order Confirmed.

|Step 1|Step 2| Step 3|
|:---: |:---:|:---:|
|![](docs/b-update1.JPG)|![](docs/b-update2.JPG)|![](docs/b-update3.JPG)|
|1 X Silver bangle size XS with G engraved added to the bag| Now update the quantity to 3 from the bag, see toast message| Add same product bt this time Size XL with H engraving|


|Step 4|Step 5| Step 6|
|:---: |:---:|:---:|
|![](docs/b-update4.JPG)|![](docs/b-update5.JPG)|![](docs/b-update6.JPG)|
|Now bag has 2 rows, same product, 2 sizes, 2 differenct engravings| From the Shopping bag change the quantity with the + button up to 5 - nbotice the + can go no further it is now disabled by the handleEnableDisable js function, Total â‚¬1000!|Now add a 3rd line to the bag, Need to do it from Product detail page as using a NEW engraving this time the K engraving, size is XS same as 1st line and quantity =1 we won't go mad this time, Total = â‚¬1125|


|Step 7|Step 8| Step 9|
|:---: |:---:|:---:|
|![](docs/b-update7.JPG)|![](docs/co-8.JPG)|![](docs/co-9.JPG)|
|Back to the shoping bag & we've to tighten our belts, we're spending too much so instead of 5 we go back to just 1 of the XL size, Notice again greying of the "minus" button as handleEnableDisable js function kicks in Total â‚¬625 ah yes much more managable!!|Just a shot of the Checkout & I'm signing up for the newsletter, BTW this checkbox is NOT checked by default, opposite to the Save delivery info checkbox which is checked by default | Ah Confirmation of the order & Notice the toast message thanks for subscribing ...Happy days!|
