* To deploy this application on Heroku, Heroku needs to understand what dependencies are required, as well as which files to run for this project.
  * Create a requirements file: in the terminal type the following command:
    * `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`
    * This file will hold a list of all dependencies required for this project.
  * Create a procfile: in the terminal type the following command:
    * `echo web: python run.py > Procfile` 
    * Make sure there is no blank line after the contents of this file.
* Commit and push these changes to GitHub.
* Login or sign up to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com).
* Select '**Create New App**' in the top right of your dashboard.
* Choose a unique app name, and select the region closest to you, then click '**Create App**'.

* In Heroku, navigate to the '**Resources**' tab, and add on '**Heroku Postgres**' with the free plan.
* Back up your current sqlite database:
  * As this database was designed without fixtures, make sure manage.py file is connected to mysql database.
  * Backup the current database for each of desired model and load it into a db.json file: in the terminal type the following command:
  `python3 manage.py dumpdata your_model_name > db.json`
  * Repeat this action for each model you wish to transfer to the postgres database (alternatively you can backup your whole database)
* Load data from db.json file into postgres:
  * Create a temporary variable in your environement named: DATABASE_URL with the value of the Postgres URL from Heroku
  * Install the following packages and freeze the requirements: in the terminal type the following commands:
    * `pip3 install dj_database_url`
    * `pip3 install psycopg2-binary`
    * `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`
  * In legato-music > settings.py, add `import dj_database_url` at top of the page
  * Connect your manage.py file to your postgres database  
    ```
    DATABASES = {
    'default':  dj_database_url.parse('DATABASE_URL')
    }
    ```
* Load your data from the db.json file into postgres: in the terminal type the following command:
  * `python3 manage.py loaddata <your_file>.json`
  * (if you have backed up several json files, repeat this action for each file)
* Make migrations to start using PostgreSQL: in the terminal type the following commands:
  * `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
  * `python3 manage.py migrate`
* Create a superuser to access the Django admin panel: in the terminal type the following command:
  * `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
  * then add a username and password in the terminal
* Install the Heroku CLI and login: in the terminal type the following command:
  * `heroku login` or `heroku login -i`
* Remove `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1` from your heroku config vars.
* Commit and push changes to GitHub.
* Add the hostname of your Heroku app to '**ALLOWED HOSTS**' in your settings.py file. This can be found in Heroku Settings > App Name.
* Navigate to the '**Deploy**' tab on your Heroku apps Dashboard, and click on '**Enable Automatic Deployment**'.
* Click open app to view the application in your browser, your app should display without any images and static files at this stage.

### 2. Amazon AWS
_Create and connect an Amazon bucket for storing images and static files._
#### S3 Bucket:
* Create a new bucket, give it a name, and choose the region closest to you.
* Go to 'Properties', turn on static website hosting, and type _index.html_ and _error.html_ for the index document & error document fields and save.
* Go to 'Permissions', and add the code block underneath this section into your CORS config to link Heroku and your S3 bucket.
* Go to the 'Permissions' tab and click on 'CORS configuration'.
* To link Heroku and your S3 bucket, paste in the following code into the area provided:
```
  [
  {
    "AllowedHeaders": [
      "Authorization"
    ],
    "AllowedMethods": [
    "GET"
    ],
    "AllowedOrigins": [
    "*"
    ],
    "ExposeHeaders": []
    }
  ]
```
* Still in the 'Permissions' tab, click 'Edit' on the 'Bucket Policy' and open the 'Policy Generator'.
* Use the following settings to setup the policy correctly:
  * _Type of Policy: 'S3 Bucket Policy'_
  * _Principal: '*' to allow all principles_
  * _Action: 'Get Object'_
  * _Amazon Resource Name (ARN): Paste your Bucket ARN and add * at the and of your Bucket Resource key arn:aws:s3:::bucket_name/_ 
  * Click 'Save'
* Still in the 'Permissions' tab, go to the 'Access Control List', Set the list of objects permission for everyone under the 'Public Access' section.

#### IAM
* Click on the 'Services' tab on the top left of the page and search for 'IAM'.
* Go to '**User Groups**', '**Create New Group**', enter a name, and click '**Create**'.
* Go to '**Policies**', '**Create New Policy**', '**JSON**', '**Import Managed Policy**', '**S3**', '**AmazonS3FullAccess**', '**Import**'.
* Get your ARN from '**S3 Permissions**', delete the `*` from '**Resource**', and add the code block underneath this section into the area.
* Click '**Next**', '**Review**', provide a name and description, and click '**Create Policy**'.
* Go to '**User Groups**', '**Find New Group**', '**Permissions**', '**Add Permissions**', '**Attach Policies**', find the policy you created, and click '**Add Permissions**'.
* Go to '**Users**', provide a name, and tick the checkbox beside '**Access key - Programmatic access**'.
* Click '**Next**', select the group you created in step 1, and click through to the end.
* Finally, click '**Create User**', and download the CSV file, which will contain your `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and your `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`. This is the only time that this CSV file will be available, so it's very important to download it at this stage.

```python
"Resource": [
    "{YOUR ARN}",
    "{YOUR ARN}/*"
]
```

#### Final AWS Steps:
* Navigate to S3, you'll see that you have a '**static**' folder with all your static files in it.
* Create a '**media**' file in your S3 Bucket, click '**Upload**'.
* Click '**Add Files**', then add all your product images.
* Under '**Manage Public Permissions**', select '**Grant Public Read Access**'.
* Then click '**Upload**'.
* Finally, attempt to log in to the site using the superuser details, then access the '**admin**' panel on the live site, go to '**Email Addresses**', and select Primary and Verified on the superuser email address.
