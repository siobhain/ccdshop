#### Checkout

##### Stripe currency & Pricing

The currency is set to Euro in settings.py as all goods are for sale from Ireland.  Stripe requires all Euro amounts to be provided in cents, cents being the smallest Euro unit.  In keeping with the business strategy of whole number pricing,  it was necessary to round up `grand_total` & `stripe_total` using `math.ceil()` when including delivery costs.


#### Product Pricing
It is a strategic business decision to opt for whole number pricing in order to maintain the feeling of exclusivity and quality in the goods.  The discerening customer would not fall for the charm pricing of say â‚¬49.99.

#### Stripe Secrets

Use `<input type="hidden"..>` to pass the `client_secret` to stripe server, With the hidden attribute set the user cannot view or interact with the value being passed

##### Redundancy for payment system on chekcout app

There is redundancy build into the Checkout app during Stripe payment processing in cases where the user might close the browser or lose power/connectivity or do something on the client/frontend side that breaks connection with the server during payment processing (the js .done .then on 'stripe.confirmCardPayment') causing the order not to be submitted to the database even though the payment has been made. This is for edge cases only and is achieved by listening for particular stripe webhooks (wh's) which operate like signals in the background and are unaffected by whats going on front end. It is the same implementation as **BoutiqueAdo**. The Stripe account is configured to send wh's to an endpoint such as `https://memorylane-jewellery-63c74e421293.herokuapp.com/checkout/wh/`. A `payment_intent.succeeded` webhook is send by Stripe to signify that the payment has been completed.  Therefore if/when that particular wh is received we know for definite that payment has been made & in normal cases the order will already have been created by `views.checkout` (abeit a slight delay in writing to db using false commit on the save `order_form.save(commit=False)`).  However in an edge case where something happens frontend so that order never gets created in the db, the `payment_intent.succeeded` wh handler will create the order if it finds that it does not exist in the db.  There is a boolean field on the Order model called 'CreatedByWebhook` to track such cases.  The site administrator can check for this phenomena using filter on the django admin interface.

## Testing

[TESTME.md](TESTME.md) file.

 
### Deploy

- Create a Database eg Elephant SQL
- Create a new Heroku app
- Connect the db to local development server
- ConfirmD DB is connected
- eploy with debug off & disable collect static
- upload media to s3 & grant public access
- create new stripe webhook endpoint (url for heroku app)
- reveal and add webhook signing secret to heroku config vars matching var names in settings.py


 Deployment 
- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab.
  - Open the pages tab on the left hand side of the page.
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch.
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

# Deployment

To clone this repository & run it locally
1. Login to GitHub (https://wwww.github.com)
2. Select the repository `siobhain/ccdshop``
3. Click the Code button and copy the HTTPS url
4. In your IDE, open a terminal and paste the git clone command `git clone https://github.com/siobhain/ccdshop.git`
5. The repository will now be cloned in your workspace
6. Create an env.py file in the root folder of your project, add these env variables with your own values, Ensure you add env.py to .gitignore so none of these values are held in version control
<br>
<code>import os</code>
<br><code>os.environ['DEVELOPMENT'] = 'your own value here'</code>
<br><code>os.environ['SECRET_KEY'] = "your own values here" </code>
<br><code>os.environ['DATABASE_URL'] = 'your own value here'</code>
<br><code>os.environ['STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY'] = 'your own value here'</code>
<br><code>os.environ['STRIPE_SECRET_KEY'] = 'your own value here'</code>
<br>
7. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required packages as per the requirements.txt file
8. Setup your DATABASES in the settings.py `
DATABASES = {
    'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
}`
9. Set debug to true in the settings.py file for local development
10. Add your hostname to the ALLOWED_HOSTS variable in settings.py
11. Run "python3 manage.py makemigrations" to make migrations
12. Run "python3 manage.py migrate" to create the database tables
13. Run "python3 manage.py createsuperuser" to create a super/admin user
14. Start the application by running `python3 manage.py runserver`

## Heroku
This project can be deployed to Heroku with the following steps:
1. Create an account on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
2. Create an app, give it a name for example myshop, and select a reg
3. Create a Database for example I used Elephant SQL 
- Create a new Heroku app
- Connect the db to local development server
- ConfirmD DB is connected
- eploy with debug off & disable collect static
- upload media to s3 & grant public access
- create new stripe webhook endpoint (url for heroku app)
- reveal and add webhook signing secret to heroku config vars matching var names in settings.pyion

3. Under resources search for postgres, and add a Postgres database to the app
4. Note the DATABASE_URL, this needs to be set as an environment variable in Heroku and your local environment variables
5. Create a Procfile with the text: web: gunicorn myshop.wsgi
6. Add your production environment variables (env.py) to Heroku's Config Vars
7. In the settings.py ensure the connection is to the Heroku postgres database
8. Ensure debug is set to false in the settings.py file
9. Add 'localhost/127.0.0.1', and 'myshop.herokuapp.com' to the ALLOWED_HOSTS variable in settings.py
10. Run "python3 manage.py showmigrations" to check the status of the migrations
11. Run "python3 manage.py migrate" to migrate the database
12. Run "python3 manage.py createsuperuser" to create a super/admin user
13. Connect the app to GitHub, and enable automatic deploys from main
14. Click deploy to deploy your application to Heroku for the first time
