#### Checkout

##### Stripe currency & Pricing

The currency is set to Euro in settings.py as all goods are for sale from Ireland.  Stripe requires all Euro amounts to be provided in cents, cents being the smallest Euro unit.  In keeping with the business strategy of whole number pricing,  it was necessary to round up `grand_total` & `stripe_total` using `math.ceil()` when including delivery costs.


#### Product Pricing
It is a strategic business decision to opt for whole number pricing in order to maintain the feeling of exclusivity and quality in the goods.  It is thought the discerening customer would not fall for the charm pricing of say â‚¬49.99.

#### Stripe Secrets

Use `<input type="hidden"..>` to pass the `client_secret` to stripe server, With the hidden attribute set the user cannot view or interact with the value being passed

##### Redundancy for payment system on chekcout app

There is redundancy build into the Checkout app during Stripe payment processing in cases where the user might close the browser or lose power/connectivity or do something on the client/frontend side that breaks connection with the server during payment processing (the js .done .then on 'stripe.confirmCardPayment') causing the order not to be submitted to the database even though the payment has been made. This is for edge cases only and is achieved by listening for particular stripe webhooks (wh's) which operate like signals in the background and are unaffected by whats going on front end. It is the same implementation as **BoutiqueAdo**. The Stripe account is configured to send wh's to an endpoint such as `https://memorylane-jewellery-63c74e421293.herokuapp.com/checkout/wh/`. A `payment_intent.succeeded` webhook is send by Stripe to signify that the payment has been completed.  Therefore if/when that particular wh is received we know for definite that payment has been made & in normal cases the order will already have been created by `views.checkout` (abeit a slight delay in writing to db using false commit on the save `order_form.save(commit=False)`).  However in an edge case where something happens frontend so that order never gets created in the db, the `payment_intent.succeeded` wh handler will create the order if it finds that it does not exist in the db.  There is a boolean field on the Order model called 'CreatedByWebhook` to track such cases.  The site administrator can check for this phenomena using filter on the django admin interface.

5. The repository will now be cloned in your workspace
6. Create an env.py file in the root folder of your project, add these env variables with your own values, Ensure you add env.py to .gitignore so none of these values are held in version control
<br>
<code>import os</code>
<br><code>os.environ['DEVELOPMENT'] = 'your own value here'</code>
<br><code>os.environ['SECRET_KEY'] = "your own values here" </code>
<br><code>os.environ['DATABASE_URL'] = 'your own value here'</code>

<br><code>os.environ['STRIPE_SECRET_KEY'] = 'your own value here'</code>
<br>
7. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all required packages as per the requirements.txt file
8. Setup your DATABASES in the settings.py `
DATABASES = {
    'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
}`
9. Set debug to true in the settings.py file for local development
10. Add your hostname to the ALLOWED_HOSTS variable in settings.py
11. Run "python3 manage.py makemigrations" to make migrations
12. Run "python3 manage.py migrate" to create the database tables
13. Run "python3 manage.py createsuperuser" to create a super/admin user

3. Create a Database for example I used Elephant SQL or you can use Heroku Postgres
  - Connect the db to Heroku app
  - Confirm DB is connected
4. Upload static and media files to AWS s3 & grant public access
5. Create new stripe webhook endpoint (url for heroku app)
6. Add these production environment variables (env.py) to Heroku's Config Vars
  - USE_AWS (set to True to use AWS)
  - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID (for access to AWS)
  - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY (for access to AWS)
