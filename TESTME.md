## LIGHTHOUSE REPORTS

<details>
<summary>üëá</summary>

Below are Lighthouse reports for the deployed project, lower than I want on performance & accessibility.  Third party code such as stripe utility , fontawesome CDN, bootstrap CDN, JQuery & google fonts effected performance but as they are necessary I was unable to improve on this. There are duplicate ARIA ID's used by ALLAuth which reduced the accessubility score.  The blue on yellow for the footer does not ahve a sufficient contrast ratio, this may not be corrected before submitting.

## CODE VALIDATION

<details>
<summary>üëá</summary>

### HTML

[HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) Screenshots

|Page |Screenshot | Notes  | 
|:---:|:----------------------:|---|
| Home  |![HTML Validation - Home](docs/v-home.JPG) | Yes <li> is not allowed in nav element but needed in this case, Duplicate ID I think has to do with one block being displayed on large screen and one for small screens, The Aria labelled was pointed out by lighthouse also, The warning can be ignored
| Products |![HTML Validation - Products](docs/v-products.jpg) | | Same errors reported as above|
| Bag | ![HTML Validation - Bag](docs/v-bag.jpg)  | The id_qty_1 duplicate ID is not actually used, it is inherited from Boutiqu eAdo code & i understand it has to do with a bug on the BAdo quantity & size when using the box, but I vewritten my own js to cater for that before I realised there was bug in BAdo, Unfortunatley I did not have the time to investigate the increment/decrement fully to safely remove the duplicate id
| Checkout | ![HTML Validation - Checkout](docs/v-checkout.jpg)  | I can't see this for/label error I don;t think its hidden |

### PYTHON


The [Code Institute Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) was used to validate Python files.

As of a week before submitting bag, products, home & profiles apps were cleared of all flake8 errors, checkout had the following

![Checkout](docs/f-checkout.jpg) 

 I did not break these 2 E501 lines in webhook handler as = 80 characters and for left alone for readibility.  WRT the F841 on webhooks - the variable e is used as far as I can tell do did not understand this complaint.|

If time allows I hope to check again before submitting.
