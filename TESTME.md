## LIGHTHOUSE REPORTS

<details>
<summary>üëá</summary>

Below are Lighthouse reports for the deployed project, lower than I want on performance & accessibility.  Third party code such as stripe utility , fontawesome CDN, bootstrap CDN, JQuery & google fonts effected performance but as they are necessary I was unable to improve on this. There are duplicate ARIA ID's used by ALLAuth which reduced the accessubility score.  The blue on yellow for the footer does not ahve a sufficient contrast ratio, this may not be corrected before submitting.

| Todo |  ![HTML Validation - Todo](docs/v-todo.jpg) | Yes there is a problem here as strictly speaking one should not have a button inside an anchor tag, This button is the Delete Task action.  The original plan was to use a modal when the user requested to delete a Task, but unfortunatley I could not get the Task ID data to the modal, I then had to revert to some sort of basic warning to the user so that where I started to use the tooltip to pop up a message to the user that this action cannot be undone & afaik to get the tooltip working I neede to use the button element.|

## USER STORY TESTING

<details>
<summary>üëá</summary>

I found that user stories (US) are a work in progress during the development of the project, I feel in a better position now that I am nearer the end of the project in defining US that I was at the start as having come through that process I now have a better understanding of them with clearly more to learn.  Armed with this knwoeldge I re define the US's here to aid in documenting US testing, Hence these will not follow the same USs as is in the  `@siobhain's CTB project`  [here](https://github.com/users/siobhain/projects/9) & deadline will not allow me to redo (regenerate) the US's on Github Project.
